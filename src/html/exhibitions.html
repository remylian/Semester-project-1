				<ul class="exhibition-items">
					<li class="exhibition-item">
						<h3>COSMOLOGY</h3>
						<img src="/assets/images/exhibitions/cosmology.jpg" alt="" />

						
								<p>
									Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The Sky Above Us',
									explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
									We'll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a
									bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
								</p>

								<p>
									Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo's
									telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.
								</p>
					</li>

					<li class="exhibition-item">

							<h3>ECOLOGY</h3>
							<img src="/assets/images/exhibitions/ecology.jpg" alt="" />

							
								<p>
									As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more
									important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future
									not just for humans but for the whole planet.
								</p>
							
					</li>

					<li class="exhibition-item">

							<h3>EVOLUTION</h3>
							<img src="/assets/images/exhibitions/evolution.jpg" alt="" />

							<div>
								<p>
									For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our
									origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his
									theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our
									place in this world.
								</p>

								<p>
									Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
									evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who
									didn't survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs
									too.
								</p>
							
					</li>

					<li class="exhibition-item">
							<h3>ROBOTICS AND AI</h3>
							<img src="/assets/images/exhibitions/robotics.jpg" alt="" />

							
								<p>
									The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are
									the science of the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses
									of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob
									the Robot.
								</p>

					</li>

					<li class="exhibition-item">
<div class="wrapper-text">
							<h3>BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE</h3>
							<img src="/assets/images/exhibitions/biomed.jpg" alt="" />

							
								<p>
									From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are
									offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
								</p>

								<p>
									For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life
									much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a
									series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some
									major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
									transplant.
								</p>

								<p>
									Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also
									from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
